About: Detect Brain Tumor - MGMT, by using given scanned MRI images

Evaluation : Area Under the ROC curve.

Predict : Probability

train_labels.csv : file containing the target MGMT_value for each subject in the training data (e.g. the presence of MGMT promoter methylation)
                 : as per this file, we have 585 images in training dataset  (not in increasing number)
                 
train/ : folder containing the training files, with each top-level folder representing a subject.
         train folder - conatins sub-folders (where sub-folder name) is ID of each image.   (we have 585 sub-folders)
         sub-folder contains - 4 more folders (FLAIR, T1w, T1wCE,T2w)  - These are types of MRI Images
         
         To more about these 4 types - https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification/discussion/252843
         
         
Ideally one main folder - should contain one image for one label
But here, one folder contains further 4 folders (i.e. type of MRI Images) - we can choose any type (depend which give better result)
Again, One Type of MRI Images - contains further lot of images for one patient - we can choose any to train the model (which gives better result)


All the Images are in .dcm format
. dcm extension represent digital image which stores medical information of patients such as MRIs, CT scans and ultrasound images. DCM files use DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) image file format and can include patient's information for reference.
==============================================================================================================================================

To pass the images into any model, we need to do below things :
1) All images should be of equal size
2) Convert it into numpy array

to convert into numpy array, first we need to read the .dcm files.
Generally to read images, we use open-cv or cv2 module.
But, cv2 does not support .dcm type files. SO we need specific module to read the.dcm file.

https://answers.opencv.org/question/52181/dicom-images-in-opencv/

we have 'pydicom' library to read dicom files
pip install pydicom

if we try to plot all images - most of the Images are totally blank
So, we can say that data-issues
So, first we need to remove those images and keep only good images
